<h1>🌱 What Is a Vegan Diet?</h1>

A vegan diet is a plant-based way of eating that excludes all animal-derived products. This means no meat, fish, dairy, eggs, or honey. Vegans rely entirely on foods that come from plants for their nutrition.

The diet is followed for different reasons, including health, ethics, environmental sustainability, and personal beliefs.

🥗 Foods Included in a Vegan Diet

A healthy vegan diet includes a wide variety of plant foods:

<h2>1. Fruits</h2>

Fresh, dried, or frozen fruits provide vitamins, minerals, and natural sugars.

Apples, bananas, berries, oranges, mangoes

<h2>2. Vegetables</h2>

Vegetables form the foundation of a vegan diet.

Leafy greens (spinach, kale, lettuce)

Root vegetables (carrots, potatoes, beets)

Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower)

<h2>3. Grains</h2>

Whole grains are the main energy source.

Rice, oats, wheat, barley, quinoa

Provide carbohydrates, fiber, and B vitamins

<h2>4. Legumes</h2>

Legumes are the primary protein source.

Beans, lentils, chickpeas, peas
