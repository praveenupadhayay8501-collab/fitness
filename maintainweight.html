Maintaining Weight – Complete Explanation
</h2>
Maintaining weight means keeping your body weight stable over time by balancing the calories you consume with the calories your body uses.
It is not about dieting or extreme control, but about creating healthy,
sustainable habits that support long-term well-being.

<h2> Calorie Balance (Simple Explanation)<h2>
<ul>
<li>Too many calories → weight gain

<li>Too few calories → weight loss

<li>Balanced calories → weight maintenance
</ul>
You don’t need to count calories strictly—portion control + food quality works better.


<h2>3. Macronutrients (Very Important)</h2>
<h3>🥗 1. Carbohydrates (45–55%)</h3>

Main energy source.

<h3>Choose:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rice (normal quantity)

<li>Roti (atta, multigrain)

<li>Oats

<li>Fruits

<li>Potatoes (boiled)
</ul>
<h3>Limit:<h3>
<ul>
<li>White bread

<li>Sugary snacks

<li>Soft drinks

<li>Bakery items
</ul>
👉 Tip: Eat carbs more in morning & afternoon, less at night.
